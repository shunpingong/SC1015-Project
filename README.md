# SC1015 Data Science Project - HDB_resalePrice

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on resale price of HDB from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teyang/singapore-hdb-flat-resale-prices-19902020). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1. [Data Preparation](https://github.com/shunpingong/SC1015-Project/blob/main/Data%20Preparation.ipynb) <br>
The code in this notebook is used to extract data from into Numerical and Categorical datasets to gain insights. After data extraction, we explore the different Categorical predictors on resale_price and dropping some that does not provide valuable information. The remaining categorical predictors are mapped and encoded to aid us for our machine learning later on.

## Problem Definition

- Given how we are entering into adult life where we have to start getting our own flats, we hope to determine
- Which factor affect the resale_price of HDB the most?
- Which model will predict resale_Price of HDB the most?

## Models Used

1. Linear Regression
2. Multivariate Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Random Forest
5. Gradient Boosting

## Conclusion

## What did we learn from this project?
